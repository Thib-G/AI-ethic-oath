# AI-ethic-oath

In today's world, AI has reached unprecedented levels of power and has become accessible to many domains.
Along with this power comes great responsibility. For the AI? or for its creators?
AI & technology development concerns the entire society and especially the developers and people in charge
of implementing technological solutions, including data product owners, data engineers, architects, and many more
technology is no longer a field reserved to developers.

This project is an attempt to establish an ethical pledge for technology developers. 
It draws inspiration from the Hippocratic oath, which has been taken by doctors upon completing their studies since 
ancient times (exact dating is debated and unknown).
Additionally, John Nosta and his AI-pocratic Oath have provided further inspiration for this endeavor.

If you like the oath, pledge by following these steps: 

1. Fork & clone the repo
3. Add an empty commit 
```git commit --allow-empty -m "I pledge"```
4. Push & create a PR

I appreciate your interest in updating the Hippocratic oath to address the advancements and 
ethical considerations of our time. I encourage you to share your suggestions for revisions, 
and I will gladly submit these ideas as an issue and make the necessary updates.
